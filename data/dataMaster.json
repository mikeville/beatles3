The positioning of the instrumental solo within a repeat of the bridge rather than a verse is unusual and likely accounts for the absence of there being a pair of verses in the middle. Contrast this with other Beatles songs of the same period that more typically place a solo in one of two intervening verse; e.g. 'I Saw Her Standing There', or even 'How Do You Do It'."

      "The form of this song is a bit tricky. On strictly musical grounds, I believe one hears it in the way that I've parsed it above, as one of the standard and familiar formal models. However, the repeat pattern of the lyrics would seem to argue otherwise; that what I've labeled a 'verse' is more of a 'refrain' because the words are unvaried over four repeats of the section. Similarly, that what I've labeled as a 'bridge' is more properly a 'verse' because it is only in that section that the words are varied. This alternate pigeon-holing scheme though would yield an unusual formal structure indeed: Intro | Refrain | Refrain | Verse | Refrain | Break | Verse | Refrain | Outro (fade-out). Hence, I'll stay with my original analysis, though this formal ambiguity caused by the disposition of the lyrics is noteworthy.",

      "Though much less directly blues-derived than either 'Can't Buy Me Love' or 'You Can't Do That', 'A Hard Day's Night' bears close comparison to both of those songs. At the very least, all three of them share the same long form, with two bridges and an instrumental break. Of course, the more interesting connection is the manner in which 'A Hard Day's Night' takes one step further the concept, seen in the other two songs, of a style borne of the fusion between traditional blues elements and those more recognizable as the Beatles' own trademarks.",
      "Next note There's a bonafide trend to be charted here: 'Can't Buy Me Love' had a verse section that was close to pure blues in form, chord progression and melody. 'You Can't Do That' retained the blues form and the chord progression, but its melody already had wavered between the minor and Major third. In 'A Hard Day's Night', only the twelve-bar length and AAB phrasing of the blues remains along with some of the minor third melodic flavor, but the rest had long since gone the way of Lennon and McCartney.",
      "Next note 'A Hard Day's Night' is a particularly forward-looking song as well. Aside from several innovations in the area of harmony and arrangement, its rhythmic resources make an especially strong contribution. As we'll see during our walk-through, behind the generally energetic and syncopated bustle that appears on the surface, there is also a great deal of forward thrust generated here by the way the music, on an almost subliminal level, toys around with surprising stop-and-go contrasts of pace and activity."

      "In addition, we run into, for the first time in this series, a situation where the two verses that precede a bridge section are subtly modified in order to effect a smoother formal transition. While this procedure is definitely not the default of the genre, neither is it all exceptional. Browsing through the Beatles canon, we find the following other examples, and the list here excludes cases in which a verse variant is used for purposes other than smoothing the bridge transition (such as only to smooth the transition to the outro, or simply for the heck of it): 'There's A Place'; 'Not A Second Time'; 'You're Going To Lose That Girl'; 'Within You Without You'; 'Good Morning Good Morning'; 'A Day In The Life'; 'I Am The Walrus'.",

It's also a fine example of a song whose form and content on the surface seems so straightforward and familiar, yet once you get past the surface glitz, and the simpler pleasures, you find a wealth of more adventurous options to be explored.",
      "Next note I embarked on this series of articles fully expecting in short order to stumble occasionally — if not quite repeatedly — into examples of formulaic Beatles songwriting. But thus far, every one I've chosen reveals its own variations, once we look at it carefully enough. I am beginning to suspect that by the time we get through the entire repertoire, we'll still not have come across too many songs in total can be said to be playing it strictly by the so-called rules.",
      "Next note In 'Any Time At All' the form is conspicuously not a variation of the more familiar one- or two-bridge models we've seen over and over again, and is noteworthy on three counts: 1) A frequently recurring refrain section dominates the song. This folk ballad-like design, while a common enough device in other pop and folk music and, is not often found in the early work of the Boys. 2) The song contains only two verses. I assume that the doubled-up length of the verses themselves, the number of repeats of the refrain, and the peculiar placement of the bridge so close to the end of the track all argue against inclusion of a late-breaking third verse. 3)The bridge itself introduces new, unique material — though the melodic material does link back to the appoggiatura stuff earlier — rather than recycling material from the refrain or the verse as is more common.",
      "Next note The two verses contain no lyrics that are repeated. Their rhyme scheme using the third and sixth line of each verse is novel.",
      "Next note In context of the refrain's starting with a long pickup and the verse's starting after the downbeat I think it's an effective — and not entirely coincidental — twist that the instrumental section starts right on the downbeat. Note how much flatter the whole song sounds if the break section simply opts for the same rhythmic gesture of either the verse or refrain."

In order to lengthen it out to match the timing of the film scene, an 'alternate' version, with the first verse repeated at the end, was artificially spliced together. This formalistic oddity can be found on the American film album (from United Artists) as well as the mono pressing of 'Something New'."

On the lyrical side here, there's a correspondingly precocious ambiguity over the exact scenario in which the song, on the surface just a plain old love ballad, takes place.",
      "Next note The one thing that does seem fairly clear is that it's about the imperturbable constancy of true love in the face of logistical challenge, or perhaps more precisely, the fear of challenge. As you might expect, one of the most exciting discoveries to be made in an analysis of such a song is the way in which the details of the music assist the words in the evocation of an otherwise difficult to verbalize complex of emotions.",
      "Next note Our friend Macca, in an interview clip from the 'Put It There' video, suggests that he chose to revive this song for the 1989/1990 tour because it 'says something nice, ... it's a simple song, ... easy to play.' What do you think? Is it that he doesn't give himself enough credit, or perhaps, are we hearing just a small note of false modesty?",
      "Next note The form is the standard two-bridge model with a single verse intervening. In context it achieves a delicate balance between the rambling and the forthright. The inclusion of two bridges is in the interest of conjuring a somewhat relaxed mood. But the omission of an instrumental solo section, which would have probably appeared either in place of the third verse or as an additional verse section preceding the second bridge, keeps the proceedings from becoming too relaxed. After all, we need to keep focused with some urgency on the fact that the protagonist has a lot that he must say right now lest this moment pass.",
      "Next note The lyrics of the four verses contain a refrain-like final couplet based on the title phrase, and they create a pattern of ABCC. The AB verses feature a characteristic 'I / we' swap, and they, along with the two bridges, rhythmically begin right on the downbeat. The CC verses are each more tightly integrated with the bridges that precede them so that they rhythmically begin well ahead of the downbeat, with the phrase 'and that's enough;' the downbeat falling in this case on the final syllable."

For my own tastes, this contrast only goes to heighten a sense of irony and intrigue about the song.",
      "Next note After all, just why the forceful delivery? Is the hero simply worried that he'll be somehow prevented by the second woman from returning 'home', or perhaps is it more the reflection of an inner ambivalence within the hero himself about wanting to effect such a return? I similarly wonder what in blazes he possibly means by the line 'I'll love her more till I walk out that door again' — just going to work or out on errands the next day after his planned return, or is this some off-handed allusion to the inevitability of repeated philandering? Such wonderfully elliptical ambiguity! :-) But getting back to the music ...",
      "Next note The most unusual item found here is the key scheme. The relatively large number of songs on the 'A Hard Day's Night' album which make conspicuous use of either relative Major/minor shifts (e.g. 'And I Love Her' and 'I'm Happy Just To Dance With You' ) or parallel Major/minor shifts (e.g. 'Things We Said Today' and 'I'll Be Back') has already been discussed in this series.

Both have the same form although the bridge of this one is closer to a 'true' bridge than the refrain-like one we saw last time. Both songs also display a split stylistic personality by utilizing relatively straight blues in the verse but not at all in the bridge.

Most unusual here is the total of three bridge sections, the middle one of which is musically different from the outer two, even though it bears some resemblance to the them.",
      "Next note The intro, at first blush, would seem almost negligible in its scant two-measure length, but is crucial for the way its being in A Major sets the surprise-trap for the verse, which follows beginning in a minor. I find it rather sublime to contemplate how what you come to later recognize as the central personality trait of this song is presented so neatly encapsulated right off at the start.",
      "Next note The outro, of course, recapitulates this same notion. For a change, the standard device of a looped figure repeating into a fade-out actually is of 'programmatic' significance to the extent that it helps us visualize our hero heading off into the metaphorical sunset with the most exquisitely ambivalent feelings in his heart.",

It's a good example of formalistic fine-tuning. While it wouldn't be the end of the world to leave this last verse just like the others, when you consider the cumulative duration of the song caused by the preceding three verses plus three bridges, it's probably a good thing the Boys decided to not keep us. Play it out in your head with a full final verse and see for yourself if you start getting a tad antsy or not.",

In 'No Reply', the bridge provides relief from the intensity and dramatic shape of the verses. The issue here is not so much that the bridge can't be repeated as much as it is that we couldn't handle more than three verses without feeling burnt out.

The lyrics are different for each verse and imply a kind of narrative that is told in second person direct address, and ends on a cliché moral note ('... pride comes be-fore a fall...'). We'll come across even more details supportive of this thesis as we do our walk-through below.",

Examples uncovered thus far in our studies include 'It Won't Be Long', 'When I Get Home', and 'You're Going To Lose That Girl'. The fact that the preceding list is entirely built out of songs that conspicuously belong to John would seem noteworthy.",

      "Next note John described it as a waltz (check his spoken lead into the song at the Paris concerts in January 1965), but in spite of the 3/4 time signature, the rapid tempo and agitated mood of the piece seem out of character with that Romantic dance form."

      "Next note In absence of the continuing story line upon which the typical folksong relies in order to sustain interest, 'Help!' makes a couple of formal adjustments to avoid rote monotony: The lyrics of the three verses create an A-B-A pattern. The texture of the instrumental arrangement is dramatically lightened up for the first half of the last verse by thinning out the drum part and eliminating the backing vocal part."

      "Next note They use the standard long form here, one of their favorites, with its two bridges that are separated by two verse sections, the second one of which is partly for instrumental solo. 'From Me To You' and 'A Hard Day's Night' come to mind as archetypal examples, but there are many others as well.",
      "Next note In addition, there is an almost subliminally unifying effect created by the recurring use of chromatic shifts and scale fragments; anticipatory shades of Paul's later 'You Won't See Me', which happens to share a certain amount of similarity with this song at the level of its subject matter."

The verse pairs are internally differentiated between a 'primary' version and a slightly modified variant that leads more smoothly into the refrain."

Though the influence in this case is not as obvious on the surface of things as it is in the case of, say, 'Paperback Writer' and 'Rain', the parallels between 'Another Girl' and 'You're Going To Lose That Girl' are as striking as they are surprising, once they've been pointed out to you.",

The last time we had seen this effect, way back in this series 'You're Going To Lose That Girl' and 'It Won't Be Long', it had thrown us off guard quite a bit. Once you parse this phrase as part of the verse proper, the form suddenly reveals itself as one of the standard forms, with two-verses, two-bridges, and only one verse intervening. The use of such a pseudo-refrain, though, especially when it also appears as the song's introductory section, does have a unique the power to, if not outright confuse, make a formalistically fluid impression."

      "Next note There are some differences, as well, the most significant of which affects the form: the music used by the Beatles for the intro, outro and break appears in the original only for the break and even there it is used in abbreviated form. At the detailed level, the original uses a boogie-like arpeggio bassline for the bridge while the Beatles stay with the oompah figuration used in the verse. Paul continues the backing vocal into the final verse whereas the original omits it. And, for those more or less exclusively acquainted with the Beatles' version, the different scanning of the words by Owens sounds somehow 'wrong' at first."

      "Recorded in mid-October 1965, 'Drive My Car' bears some uncanny associations with both sides of a certain 'double-A' single of our acquaintance that was coincidentally worked on in the studio during the same week. To my ears, the rap-like declamation of the lyrics and anti-melody of 'Day Tripper' (not to mention the lubricious 'driving' metaphor), and the slow triplets of 'We Can Work It Out' strongly resonate here.",
      "By the same token, 'Drive My Car' also has a few unique aspects to it. The form is the flat one of the folk ballad in which four pairs of verse and refrain are presented in a row with the only relief coming in the way of a guitar solo for one of the verse sections. The vocal parts are exceedingly dissonant. And most unusual of all, the particular use of harmony here makes your clear sense of the home key an extremely elusive proposition much of the time.",
      "In true ballad the refrain lyrics are unvarying while the words of the four verses are all different. The lyrics, while not quite unique or ground breaking per se, are notably Lennonesque in the way they weave such a suggestively droll tale from scraps of small talk that are pieced together so that it's not immediately obvious who said what to whom. I especially like the tag line, 'and maybe I'll love you.' Whadaymean, maybe!?",
      "Rhythmically, the verses always start after the downbeat, the refrain starts right on the downbeat, and the beep-beep coda starts with a long wind up ahead of the downbeat."

In lesser hands, the large amount of unvaried repetition and static harmony of this piece might have resulted in a moribund, boring mess. The Beatles leverage it all in favor of and unity and focus.",

What I am particularly struck by, given the novelty-numbing distance of time, is the extent to which the psychedelic buzzing of that exotic instrument is so uncannily complemented here by the high level of percussive noise achieved by using a hard pick on the otherwise standard twelve-string guitar."

      "The comparison to 'Little Child', by the way, turns out to be more apt than you'd think at first blush — no snickering back there :-) If nothing else the two songs share a nod to the pure twelve-bar blues form and a correspondingly shouting R&B vocal style. Even more interesting though is the extent to which, in both songs, one has a hard time deciding what kind of labels (chosen from the routine list of 'verse', 'bridge', or 'refrain') to place upon each of the formal sections.",
      "There are a few relatively unique formal touches here as well: (a) what I've been referring to lately as the 'flat folksy' form (with its rote sequencing of sectional pairs), (b) dissonant deployment of a static ostinato in the bridge, (c) holding back of the instrumental break until quite late in the song, and (d) allowing that break to spill over into the verse section which follows it."

      "This predominantly acoustic, stylized folk ballad embodies many of the trends, themes, and techniques that characterize the overall image of 'Rubber Soul'. It often does seem unfairly lost in the shadow cast by certain bigger hits on the album. Yet, even though it may be neither as trenchant as 'Norwegian Wood' nor as sublime as 'In My Life', 'Girl' does contain much to be admired; particularly in its intense yet oblique baring of the author's heart it lies directly along a vector from the earlier 'You've Got Hide Your Love Away'.",
      "Considering that the Beatles didn't go in for full-fledged modulations all that much in their songs, this one is quite notable for the way in which it keeps changing key throughout. In particular, it makes use of the technique of alternating between a minor key and its relative Major towards ends that are both expressive and structural. Paul would appear to have as much a soft spot as John for this gambit over the long run. Off the top of my head we've seen it most before in 'Not A Second Time', 'And I Love Her', and 'Yesterday'.",
      "The form is of interest for its inclusion of both a refrain and a bridge, as well as its placement of the instrumental solo so near to the very end; the latter, yet another connection with 'You've Got Hide Your Love Away'."

      "Above all, the song creates a delicate and delicious balance between heart baring intimacy of the first order and a vaguely subordinate and reticent unease. The closest I can pinpoint the latter is to something not quite straightforward about some of the chord progressions and the way in which the tune runs roughshod over them. In the final result, this 'unease' is something that, as a long term listener, I feel more strongly than I can discern with any precision. But if I am at all on the right track, it is as though whatever confidence is shared within the confines of this song is done so at no small cause of pain, as though it were happening compulsively on some level, in spite of the author's will."

      "There's a higher than average level of formalistic interest in this song: it opens right in the midst of the action with an off-the-beat vocal pickup; there's no intro, not even an instrumental downbeat to give the singer his cue. For that matter, there's no formal outro here either; the song kind of just rhetorically grinds to a halt.",
      "Furthermore, the main expository component of this song is curiously half-verse/half-refrain in style. It's almost tempting to parse the section as two discrete sections in their own right but that would lead to a rather over-busy reading of the form which I don't believe is supported by your experience of listening to it.",
      "What's particularly fascinating is that not only have we seen both of the above formal features in other earlier songs of the Beatles, but in a couple of cases we've seen both features within the same song; to wit — 'I Want To Hold Your Hand', 'It Won't Be Long' and 'You're Going To Lose That Girl'. And if the strong John Connection doesn't yet strike you, consider the following punch list of songs which feature the verse/refrain concept, albeit without a midst-of-action opening — 'Please Please Me', 'From Me To You', and 'Ticket To Ride'. Granted, you can likely find me similar examples which are not all exclusively by John; Paul's 'All My Loving' comes immediately to mind, for example. Nevertheless I believe the correlation I've cited bears some weight.",

      "Everybody, including John himself, has apologized or made excuses for this song somewhere along the line. You'd think that this one must be one of the more obvious last-minute fillers hastily thrown together before the 'Rubber Soul' drop-deadline. When you go to check Lewisohn's recording diary, though, you're surprised to find out that it was one of the first tracks recorded for the new album!",
      "Furthermore, we now live in a time where we've been sensitized and dismayed by a rising tide of ubiquitous domestic violence to the point where the words of this song seem in plain bad taste. Personally, I can vouch that even way back at the time of its initial release, people thought that the Jealous-Guy-Posturing heard here was at least a tad over-stated, especially for supposedly good clean fun.",
      "It's a shame since musically at least, even if it's not top-drawer Beatles' music circa late 1965, it's not really such a bad song, per se. The style is that hard-to-categorize mix of blues (dig that lead guitar riff), pop-rock (the old cliché I -» vi chord progression), and even a touch of the folksy (if you'll note the use of the acoustic rhythm guitar) so characteristic of the middle-period Boys.",

      "One of the most curious side-bars on the history of music in the late sixties has to be the apparently sudden flash point of interest in, and influence of, the so-called Classical Music of India. The Beatles, George in particular, were prime catalysts of this faddish phenomenon, and a song like our 'Love You To' can hardly be talked about without some consideration of the historical context...At the time it seemed like many people who, just the week before had never seen a sitar or heard of Ravi Shankar, were running out, overnight, to buy what we nowadays call 'world music' recordings, tickets to rug concerts, and even authentic instruments. ",
      "The music is not only built out of unfamiliar techniques, but is also reflective of a different world outlook — think about the extent to which harmony in Western music implies '<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology' target='_blank'>teleological</a> movement or progress', and, by contrast, the extent to which detailed elaboration over a drone conjures a so-very-different mood of quiet contemplation of the world without-and-within.",
      "Here, in 'Love You To', we find a genuinely Indian-styled usage of mode, melody, rhythm and instrumentation. Even the form, which otherwise maintains a 'neo-classical' boxy rock form preserves the Indian convention of an out-of-tempo improvised slow intro."

      "Although the most conspicuous feature of 'She Said She Said' is the metrical high jinks of the bridge, this song also provides us with object lessons about two other general compositional topics: how to experiment without things falling apart, and the special characteristics of modal harmony.",
      "Experimentation! Among other things, this song teaches us yet another of the composer's trade secrets: whenever you are pushing one parameter of your musical grammar to the max, hold at least some if not all of the other parameters steady lest your meaning become obscured by sensory overload, or your composition come apart as though from centrifugal force. This principle potentially operates on many different levels to the extent that the 'parameters' involved may include as diverse elements as form, rhythm, texture, harmony, even lyrics.",
      "In spite of the fact that 'She Said She Said' flaunts inscrutably psychedelic lyrics, heavy limiting applied to virtually every instrument as well as the voice track, and of course, that wobbly meter, it also sports a positively buttoned down, classic form; i.e. the two-bridge model with a single verse intervening.",
      "The lyrics create the relatively common form of ABCC; i.e. new lyrics for the first three verses, with the third's set of lyrics repeated the fourth and final time around.",
      "No matter how experimental they were in other aspects of composition, The Beatles with very rare exception, clung to such classic forms in their songs; it is as though they needed these forms as a bedrock on which to anchor their experiments lest they fall apart.",
      "The usage of asymmetric, acyclic (albeit clearly articulated) forms are rare enough in their output that their identification and examination as a group would itself make an interesting study. Start with 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun' and 'You Never Give Me Your Money' and see how many more you can find!",
      "Going even further, I'm tempted to argue that it is no coincidence that the even fewer cases where they abandoned articulated form entirely, (e.g. 'Revolution #9', 'What's the New Mary Jane') have turned out to be among their least popular work over the long run. All this is not intended as a criticism; I mention it to acknowledge that for all their glibly touted breaking of barriers, the Boys were really neo-classicists at heart."

One of the amazing aspects of this song is the extent to which this collage not merely hangs together, but pulls into such a powerfully focused, unified effect.",
      "The intro here is not so much a fade-in as it is a small variation of the typical staggered/layered intro. Similarly, the ending is not so much a fade-out as it is a musical disintegration. You might find it interesting to compare the ending of 'Tomorrow Never Knows' with almost anything written during the sixties by one contemporary American composer, Elliott Carter, who explicitly cultivated an aesthetic in his endings of a universe winding down and flying apart; complete with excerpts from classical poetry in his liner notes to support his point of view."

In other words, the likes of 'Mr. Kite' et al would be lost on your partner at this point, so bide your time, eh?",

More on that later.",
      "Next note The form is, yet again, 'creatively derived' from standard pop song formats, but is still unusual if you look at it closely. I was almost going to combine what I've called here the Verse and the Refrain into one sixteen-measure section; after all, we've seen other Beatles' songs in which the ending of the Verse has strong Refrain-like elements — take a look at 'Please Please Me', 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' and 'Ticket to Ride'. I decided against this parsing of the form because of the way the final Refrain follows the second bridge all by its lonesome."

You could just as easily parse it with the bridge as an extension of the refrains, and labeling the first one as 'extremely lacking'.

Similarly, I've called labeled the intervening section as a bridge because of its wandering harmonic character; again, the words change each time. Yet, some people might be more comfortable labeling it as a verse, as long as you call the other section a refrain. Beyond a point, it's a matter of semantics more than anything else.

      "This song surely belongs in McCartney's top drawer. On one level, it is one of his most explicit efforts in the evocative direction of the Early Romantic (nineteenth century) 'art song'. Yet, on another level, it can also be described as an intriguing fusion of the sort that is arguably one of Paul's specialties of the house.",
      "Next note The form is completely flat (no pejorative connotations, please) with four uninterrupted iterations of the verse-and-refrain sections. This ballad form is equally at home in both folk music as well as the art song; for examples of the latter, browse through Schubert's cycle, 'Die Schöne Müllerin'. For examples of the former, see anything by Pete Seeger or Peter, Paul and Mary, or any song on 'Blonde on Blonde', with the exception, of course, of 'I Want You (So Bad)' (how's that for a Beatles / Dylan cross-pollination!!), 'Just Like A Woman', and maybe one or two others.",
      "Next note Lyrically, the song explores some of the same themes of lonely, alienated isolation covered in the likes of 'Eleanor Rigby' or 'She's Leaving Home'. Whereas the earlier songs for the most part merely suggest the inner lives, thoughts and feelings of their protagonists through attention to tell-tale, albeit painfully mundane details, we find the attention focused here almost exclusively on the main character's inner life, with the external references having become vague and abstract. Contrast, for example, Father MacKenzie's darning of socks with the unnamed 'man of a thousand voices'."

      "There's little if any proof of it in the officially recorded legacy, but we have indisputable evidence that the very Early and Late Beatles loved to jam; to set a simple chord progression (more often than not, but not always a twelve-bar blues frame) and improvise their instrumental hearts out until exhausted, bored, or both.",
      "Next note Look back at the 1960' Quarrymen tapes that survive: more than an hour of innocently aimless twelve-bar jam sessions plus a comparatively well thought out twelve-bar theme and variations, in the minor mode, no less, that makes the cut on 'Anthology', Volume 1, as 'Cayenne'; hmm..., my copy of the venerable 'Quarrymen Rehearse With Stu Sutcliff [sic!] Spring 1960' identifies a more complete mastering of the same performance as 'Thinking Of Linking (Inst.),' but of course we know that's wrong :-)",
      "Next note At the far end, you find the (unreleased) 'Get Back' and 'Abbey Road' session tapes full of jam sessions; in the case of the former, we have seemingly endless versions of 'Dig It' and (my favorite), an extended version of 'Sun King''s intro on top of which is superimposed a vamp of 'Don't Let Me Down'. In the case of the latter, we have the unedited raw tapes of both 'Something' and 'You Never Give Me Your Money'.",
      "Next note In the middle, there appears to be a dearth. Okay, there's the infamous take 7 ('We got a song and an instrumental there ...') of 'She's A Woman', and '12-Bar Original'. Anything else? Did they somehow loose the taste for it, or did they have the humility to just not tape it all?",
      "Next note And then, there is this 'Arial Tour Instrumental' curiosity; a bit too fully choreographed to pass as a true improvisation, but rather less fully developed than we'd expect for a composition from our Own Sweet Boys by this point of their career. Hell, even 'Cry For A Shadow' has more fully-invested calories than this one!"

For a change, no explicitly Indian instruments are incorporated, nor is there anything much in the way of fancy rhythmic or metrical fireworks.",

The two tracks are both in the same key, and both are slow paced and static in form. This winds up making the second of the two seem more lugubriously plodding and monotonous than it might otherwise seem.",
      "Next note I mean, let's not mince words — 'Blue Jay Way' pursues a kind of plodding monotony to purposely make a point. I just think that 'Flying' is a particularly poor choice of an animal act for it to have to follow. In both the film, as well as the original EP lineup (where it appears by itself on side D, it has much more breathing space in which to be."

Regarding the latter, I got punched hard in the stomach once, in the 9th grade, when I leaned across the aisle in home room and whispered to one tough guy Leo Sullivan from Coney Island the words, 'Your mother ...'"

      "Many times I've told you how wherever you find the Beatles at their most far out you also find them, under the surface, operating on their most classical instincts. So don't be fooled here: no matter what else you may respond to in this wonderfully outrageous song, you should acknowledge the extent to which it ultimately weighs in as a (granted, extremely stylized and abstract) talkin' blues number. In this regard I'm thinking not just of the patter style declamation of the words, but also of the formal use of phrases in groups of three, and the prominent exposure given to the V -» IV -» I progression, especially in context of a song whose harmony is otherwise quite out to lunch.",
      "Even the two unusual formal details of this song are precedented by surprisingly early efforts by the same composer: Verses that are followed by refrains are subtly different from those which are followed by other verses. Take a look back at 'I Should Have Known Better'. The intro reappears in the middle of the song. Look all the way back for this to 'Thank You Girl', which is also bears interesting comparison to 'Walrus' in terms of the pseudo bluesy bone structure."

Also, there's a kitchen-sink presentation of so many of these tricks in a single number that is, prior to 'Strawberry Fields Forever', quite unprecedented."

On a good day, though, he could demonstrate an extraordinary talent for melting several such styles so that the whole becomes something not just 'greater than,' but somehow Different From and Elevated Above, the mere Sum of its Parts. And 'Penny Lane', in my humble opinion, was the product of a very good day.",

Its genesis and original debut are matters of recording and broadcast history, the details of which I urge you to seek elsewhere to the extent that they are relatively tangential to our own perspective on the music, per se. I could easily argue, by the same token, that the song cannot be considered in isolation of the broadcast's production values and effect; but maybe I'm just being perverse, a wiseguy, or both :-)",
      "Next note I do strongly recommend that you exert yourself to hear a good quality, complete version of the actual broadcast of the 25th June 1967, and as much of the video clips of it that have shown up in various documentaries over the years. Media-wise, this track is designed with sort of the reverse experiential strategy used in 'A Day In The Life'. There, the blind mystery of the audio-only medium adds an important element of surprise. Here, without the video clues, I dare say that some of the complexity and point of the proceedings is lost. The string players with their clunky earphones, the group also wearing earphones while sitting on high stools, and the crowd of all our friends sitting on the floor in their colorful 'costumes' are somehow part of the message that is lost on vinyl; Professor McLuhan should have been impressed.",
      "Next note The form contains the unusual twist of opening with three consecutive verses. I prefer to parse this at the high level with the first verse being more a part of the intro than of the body of the song; note how this first verse does not present the tune of the song, but rather establishes the 'love, love, love' chorus part which serves as vocal wallpaper for the rest of the verses which follow. And, yes, I know; for the later verses the pattern is changed to a melisma on a single utterance of The Word.",
      "Next note The music is cast in a variation of the campy, anthem-ic march style used before on the likes of 'Yellow Submarine', though in this case, the number of diverse montage elements used is more complex than before, and the limping meter used in the verses prevents the 'march' from sounding too obvious.",
      "Next note The words, too, contain more interest than initially meets the eye. You not only have the clever retrograde of the title phrase ('love is all you need'), but also some rather off-handedly delivered philosophical observations on the ironic tension between the attempts you make to self-direct life's course and the way you learn from experience to accept the influence of so-called destiny. Yes, the lyrics are more to the point than my characterization of them."

      "Coming on the heels of what the Beatles had been putting out for the two years previous (i.e. 'Revolver' through 'Magical Mystery Tour' albums plus all the contemporaneous singles), this track has the fresh impact of a palate-cleansing, eye-catching, and ear-opening album opener, if ever there was one: butte, rhythmically tricky, full of not-so-vague tribute-cum-parodistic references, and still, not least of all: Right-on, Hard-edged Rock-n-Roll Music, just the same; thank you.",
      "Next note You'd have to have been born on another planet, or at least in a different century, to miss the several Beach Boys references. I dare say the Ray Charles' 'Georgia On My Mind' reference is a tad more subtle (note Paul's Quarrymen cover of 'Hallelujah I Love Her So'). But you need be a real Oldies maven to catch the ultimate allusion here, to Chuck Berry's 'Back in the USA'; see our .sig file du jour's quotation for confirmation; and don't tell me that Paul didn't know about this.

      "Here we've got another fine example of how John took that same droney aesthetic with which George was so enthralled and went much further with it in terms of synthetic creativity. George may have felt both isolated and patronized by Lennon and McCartney as a songwriting team and one some level; just because you're rejection sensitive it doesn't mean they're not really out to ignore you :-) However, I suspect that on an individual basis, John at least took note of, and more than a passing interest in George's musical preoccupations. Granted, this interest didn't yield much in the way of direct collaboration; 'Cry For A Shadow' is something of a fluke, after all. But in terms of the more subtle question of indirect influence and inspiration, the common thread that runs through the likes of 'Rain', 'Tomorrow Never Knows'; and the subject of this specific study is intriguing.",
      "Next note 'Dear Prudence' has not only a static harmonic profile, but even a formally flat floor plan; a steady stream of harmonically identical verses interrupted only once at the formal mid-point by a simple bridge which, itself, is as harmonically single-minded as the rest of the song.",
      "Next note The impressive accomplishment is that such a satisfying build up of tension and its release is achieved In Spite Of All Stasis :-) The challenge is to create a sense of build up without relying much at all on either harmony or melody. Instead, the strategy is to carefully sustain an atmosphere within which texture and dynamic crescendo are developed over the long run."

      "This little bonsai tree of a song compels our interest from at least three perspectives, no matter how slight you may find it in terms of content.",

Bungalow Bill'. The gesture represents a theatrical exploitation of the LP album qua 'medium' that is not to be under-estimated.",
      "Next note Secondly, this song is, in terms of form, much more of a complete miniature than an offhanded fragment; as long as you're willing to step back and accept a rather minimalistic/schematic definition of 'form.' Paul would play this trick at least twice more with 'Why Don't We Do It In The Road' and 'Her Majesty'. The 'Brother, can you take me back ...' coda to 'Cry Baby Cry' provides a clearly fragmentary counter example. And the mini-medleys of, say, 'Happiness Is A Warm Gun' and 'You Never Give Me Your Money' alternatively suggest how similar fragments can be successfully integrated to produce a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts."

The other version, take 1, available for years in bootleg and finally released officially on 'Anthology 3', is very much the opposite in tone; introspectively quiet and quite simply arranged, essentially for solo voice and acoustic guitar, with just a hint of harmonium toward the end.",
      "Next note And yet, one might say that the expressive core of 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' is to be found more deeply embedded in the musical elements which are in common between the two versions than it is to be found among the details of their contrasting arrangements, no matter how interesting it may be to explore and compare their details.",
      "Next note Within the melody, chord progressions, and formal phrasing of the song we discover a thoroughly sad lament in which there is ironic tension on at least two levels: first, the contrast between the ploddingly slow tempo and continually restless progression of chords; second, the predominance of downward-moving gestures which conjure a mood of pessimism, despite the intermittent appearance of upward gestures that you would half-expect to lighten things up a bit.",
      "Next note While the emphasis in this article will be on the so-called common musical elements, we will also take a close look, along the way, at the difference between the two versions.",
      "Next note In between these two extremes, by the way, was yet another arrangement which has not been released officially or otherwise. From Lewisohn's commentary it sounds rather similar to the official version would appear to have been scrapped as a matter of its having become overdeveloped with too many overdubs and manipulations of tape speed."

      "This song represents a most intriguing formal experiment, one that you might describe as a 'teleological medley'. It manages to project an integrated impression in ironic spite of its acyclical form, and varied sequence of styles, and meters. The Beatles' ultimate grand example of this formal approach is, of course, the 'Huge Melody' that ends 'Abbey Road', but, it's this track on which you hear it first!",
      "Next note In contrast to the 'Abbey Road' medley, where most of the sections could survive extraction from their immediate context to serve as an independent 'numbers' per se, you find here, with perhaps the exception of the final 'title' section, that the individual components are quite fragmentary and rely heavily on immediate repetition of a single idea to establish any sense of formal autonomy. There's not quite enough substance in any of them to stand on their own; otherwise you just might go as far as calling this a 'suite'; which latter term, now that I think of it, would be appropriate for 'Abbey Road'.",
      "Next note The primary force that holds it together and prevents it from otherwise sounding like a random grab bag is the modulated development of intensity and mood created by the specific sequencing of the sections; each new section builds on what has preceded it while adding something new. Secondarily, the changes of meter either between or within every section establish themselves as a kind of leitmotif.",

      "Next note The form is complicated, albeit in subtle terms: A larger than average quotient of precious bandwidth is monopolized by purely instrumental music; i.e. the long intro, mid-section break, and outro. That instrumental intro encompasses one complete verse section, thus 'forcing' the unusual deployment of only a single sung verse before the first bridge. Similarly, the instrumental verse section in the middle 'forces' the final verse to be the only other sung verse in the entire song. Though the piece includes two bridges, the first one includes an extension that is cavalierly omitted the second time 'round.",
      "Next note The verse includes a Charleston-like syncopated repeat of the first melodic fragment, thereby setting up an asymmetrical interpolation of two excess beats within the first line of the song. Paul would much later employ a variation of this same technique in 'Two Of Us'; listen (I command you!) to the early run-throughs of the latter (the first track on the venerable 'Songs From The Past', Volume 4) in which Paul adjures his colleagues to listen to how well 'it works' as he 'rhythms it' for them, demo style."

We also find here a substance-amplified unsteadiness (implied in both the lyrics, and more subtly in the moderato fox-trot back-beat) that curiously reminds me of the 'tipsy' beat you find in some of Ravel's 'Valses Nobles et Sentimentales'.",
      "Next note The increased intensity of the refrain compared to the verse creates an impression of a parallel increase in the tempo, but it's only an illusion. One of the song's real charms is the manner in which the quietly ascending bassline leads into the third verse as though 'nothing' had happened in the previous, ranting refrain section.",
      "Next note That ascending bassline pickup which opens the track turns out to be a mirror image of the bassline riff which ended the previous song. Chalk it to being either 'no coincidence' or a very happy one, at the very least. The key shift between the two songs of a subtle half-step upward bears an uncanny (and also 'coincidental') parallel with the half-step downward shift displayed by the transition of 'Eleanor Rigby' to 'I'm Only Sleeping'; even the specific keys involved are the same!"

      "Next note For example, he says, the deployment of a brief instrumental intro before every verse is a technique you'll find occasionally in so-called nineteenth century art songs; e.g. page through any book of Schubert Lieder and you'll undoubtedly run into some examples. Please label this 'Classical Exhibit Number 2'. Its usage here makes for a bulky form which, in turn, makes the song feel 'longer' than it actually is; only 2:04, including the trailing pig snorts!"

That's an excessively highfalutin way of saying, gee, the whole three and a half minute track is played out over the same unvarying eight-bar chord progression, and yet, rather than sounding painfully monotonous, it creates the impression of a something developed with the full formal scale and variety you typically expect from a 'song'!",

In that context, you could imagine the song being delivered as a rocking bluesy number, in the manner of 'Can't Buy Me Love'.

Then, the same gesture is repeated at the very end of the song, this time, in order to provide the outro.

      "Next note The 'wrenching meter' effect here is caused by switching the meter from 4/4 to 3/4 for two measures of the last phrase of the refrain. John had used essentially the same gambit in 'Strawberry Fields Forever'; but you won't read about that in the newspapers :-)",
      "Next note The lyrics are a rather extreme example of John's talent for milking poetic ambiguity from small bites of clichéd small talk: 'Come on / take it easy'. The amazing thing is how the roots of this go as far back as such early tracks as 'Yes It Is'."

From a surface glance, you might call this one George's own take on 'I'm So Tired'; low, low, low-key soliloquy of lugubrious longing (watch it, Alan, you're overdoing it), produced in such a way that you worry that the protagonist won't have the energy needed to perform satisfactorily.",

      "You know I'm not a big fan of Paul's Old Fashioned Parodies, but I admire this song for its craftsmanship and authenticity of detail in virtually every department, right down to narrative fairy tale of working girl to legend of the silver screen. The more familiar you are with dance or show tunes of the Roaring Twenties or from the very primitive 'talkie' films of the early thirties, the better you can appreciate it. Yes, some of you may also associate it with Guy Lombardo, though to be sure, his Royal Canadians of many a New Years Eve television broadcast were themselves already exploiting it for nostalgia-inducing capabilities.",
      "Next note The form is an extended variation on the standard two-bridge model, with a lengthy intro, a triplet of verses between the bridges, and a pair of verses at the end. Three of the many verse sections are predominantly instrumental, suggestive of the little dance interludes you'd expect to find in this stage-oriented genre.",
      "Next note The use of an intro that is in a slower tempo and contains music and lyrics not heard anywhere else in the song proper is a conspicuous period detail. 'Do You Want To Know A Secret' is about the closest the Beatles ever come to this on their own. In the close-but-no-cigar category you have 'Misery' (slow, but exposes the song's title tag line), and 'If I Fell' (with unique content but securely within the same tempo as the rest of the track)."

But in any event, it's the unexplained and ambiguous, just-this-side-of-nasty needling of the refrain that fascinates you in spite of yourself.

      "As one of the more infamous achievements of the mid twentieth century avant garde, this form of musical composition challenges the listener on both psychological and philosophical grounds. The extent to which the pervasive ambiguity of content teases the listener into projecting a personalized vision of continuity onto the music opens up a radical new dimension to the experience we call 'listening'. Similarly, the extent to which the background 'noise' of real life provides the same kind of narrative ambiguity if we bother to attend to it as thoughtfully as we do to so-called music, then the line between what we call a 'composition' and what is merely 'random noise' is significantly blurred if not eradicated."

It's a later take of the song, more carefully arranged and more crisply performed than the one on the 'Get Back' album. And to give the devil his due, it's one of the only songs on the album for which Spector delivers a mix whose 'finish' (in the photo processing or wood furniture sense of the word) feels appropriate to the style and mood of the music.

At the high level it is close to the flat form of the folk ballad, in which a grouping of sections is repeated several times as a group, per se. The unusual touch here is the interpolation of what I've called the 'Mantra' before each refrain.",
      "Next note Additionally, each sectional grouping starts off with a pair of verses, but you discover that two distinct but very similar verse variations are used, and each grouping orders them differently. The first pair is V/V', the second pair V/V, and the third pair V'/V. The end result is charming particularly because of the casual, offhand manner in which this undeniable amount complexity of detail is played out."

      "'I Me Mine' is an interesting folk/blues stylistic hybrid with more than just a touch of the hard rocking waltz beat.",

There's both the indelible video image of John and Yoko ridiculingly waltzing to the song just for yuks in the 'Let It Be' film, and a bootlegged outtake (Yellow Dog's CD 'All Things Must Pass', part 2: acoustic, track 9) on which John not only sings along in a mock schmaltzy operatic voice, but in reaction to the ternary beat tells George, 'Run along, son. We're a rock and roll band,' and by way of example, recites a four square 'boom-pah boom-pah' rhythm. This itself is ironic when you consider John's own penchant for the 3/4 meter, as well as his conspicuous absence from the eventual recording of the official version of 'I Me Mine' in early January 1970.",
      "Next note The form alternates Verse and Refrain sections with no outro, ending off just where you'd expect the usual transition to the next Refrain. In consideration of the recording history and the available outtakes, you get the impression George never had, or took, the time to truly finish the piece; that they might not have taken it as far as they wound up doing if not for a sense of obligation to include it on the album because parts of it would appear in the film; shades of 'Across The Universe'.",
      "Next note The early outtakes of the song, all from the 1/8/69 sessions, demonstrate an uncertainty about how to segue into and out of the Refrain, with a variety of experiments using a Flamenco-like beat for the transition that was clearly (thankfully?) lost on the way to the session for the official version a few days shy of a complete year later."

      "Given the sometimes seemingly endless hours and even days on end of the Beatles drifting out of one loosely coupled but extended jam session into another during the 'Get Back' month of January 1969, our snippet of a song here, 'Dig It', would appear to bear an unfair and awesome burden, serving as the sole remnant of such musical horseplay to make the cut for the official 'Let It Be' album.",
    "Next note But 'Dig It' also demonstrates once again how even humblest of Beatles recordings bears examination and provokes thought. No matter that the specific musical content here is arguably slight. It's the exploitation of the recorded medium for its own sake that creates value in this case. And more irony: it doesn't really matter if it was genuinely Phil Spector's own idea to handle it in this manner. The upside credit for just about anything good on the 'Let It Be' album acrues to the group themselves, with Spector left holding the bag for what's wrong with it. So much for the Beatles as nature intended.",
    "Next note The official release of this song on the 'Let It Be' album is a scant minute-long choice cut excerpted from a much longer performance of it in the studio, with a spoken bit from an entirely different arrangement of the same number tacked on to the ending. This simple yet deft act of audio retouching uncannily elevates an otherwise half baked, improvisationally executed idea (as evidenced by the film clips and unedited audio tape) into a recorded 'gesture,' at once both inspired for wild zaniness and presciently apt in the way it sets up Paul's big anthem which follows. But no offence intended: anyone who has ever goofily jammed with friends at a home party must listen to this track and think on some level, 'gee, I can do just as well as this.'",
    "Next note In spite of its comparable brevity, 'Dig It''s gesture should not be confused with what I've described elsewhere as the complete-but-miniature 'bonsai song form;' see the notes on 'Wild Honey Pie' and '... In the Road'. 'Dig It' is different, both in its circular, undifferentiated form, and the extent to which the fade-in tips you off that what you're listening to is taken out of context from something much longer. Actually, the circular form only goes to add to the illusion of open ended duration."

      "Here we have a medium slow, medium hard bluesy groove whose casual production values belie a unique Beatles experiment with form.",
      "Next note The single most notable feature here is the alternation and eventual superimposition of two separate songs. It's more than just a medley; the fancy college board musicology term for it is a 'quodlibet'. Aside from the many learned Baroque specimens of this technique, you can find two very well known examples from the Broadway show repertoire of the late fifties: 'West Side Story's dueling versions of 'Tonight' (one by the rival gangs, and one by Maria), and 'Music Man''s alternation of 'Goodnight My Someone' with 'Seventy Six Trombones'.",
      "Next note The lyrics sport that clever yin/yang alternating wordplay that's a Beatles favorite way back to their early period. Here we find the 'Oh yeah/oh no', 'wandering/wondering', and 'hard year/good year'.",
      "Next note That said, there's a part of me's got a feeling they're really not trying very hard with this one; that what may have started off as a really clever idea is eventually held back from greatness by the relative mediocrity of its raw materials, and the extent to which its two parts fail to contrast to sufficient effect. The two Broadway classics mentioned above, show how it's 'really' supposed to be done."

      "With the exception of the two 'Anthology' singles the 'One After 909' must easily be the oldest 'new' Beatlesong ever. Its official release date, as part of the 'Let It Be' album, was May 1970, yet there are home recordings of the pre-Beatles playing the song virtually ten full years earlier.",
      "Next note It's a paradox: they supposedly held it back for so long because they never did feel it was quite ready for prime time. Indeed, in comparison to just about any other original song released on their first couple albums and singles, 'One After 909' is an unusually simple and straightforward song in every compositional category.",
      "Next note In contrast to some of the subtle formalistic variants you'll find even in their early works, this one is fully cranked out with its two bridges and a guitar solo modelled on the pattern of the verse section. You might even say the form is a bit boxy from the way all the sections are built out of even numbers of four-measure phrases.",
      "Next note On the other hand, the stylized blues tint of the music allow it to fit in just about anywhere in the Beatles canon. And the lyrics have a deadpan bite and ambiguity in spite of the simple story they tell that can somehow pass for later, or at least 'mature' Beatles fare.",
      "Next note Some truth in advertising: much of this particular note is drawn from a longer article published in The 910 (Vol.I, No.7) tracing the evolution of the song through a succession of bootleg recordings. For the moment let's just focus on the official recording."

      "Macca does it again: in spite of his unabashed and sometimes even shameless sentimentality, he comes up with an affecting, durable torch song with 'The Long And Winding Road'. The secrets of his success are to be found in the manner in which novel approaches to form and harmonic structure underscore the emotional core of the song, and belie whatever curbside surface clichés it has which may initially turn you off.",
      "Next note The song appears to describe a repeatedly thwarted passion in whose ultimate fulfillment the hero maintains unshakable faith. The underlying music goes so far as to confirm such fulfillment, even though the words, if you read them carefully, indicate the outcome has not yet become an eventuality, nor may it be taken for granted. It's kind of like Dylan's 'Tangled Up In Blue' done up McCartney style; accent on vulnerability in place of bitter irony, no fancy tricks with timelines, and a more or less happy ending.",
      "Next note A thwarting of desire is suggested in the harmony by the relentlessness with which the relative minor key of c attempts to upstage and derail the true home key of Eb. Both Paul and John had played with Major/minor tonal schemes in many songs over a long period of time (for oldies sake look back to 'And I Love Her' and 'I'll Be Back'), but 'The Long And Winding Road' is one of the most sophisticated examples of it in the songbook.",
      "Next note The restless discomfort that becomes a secondary infection borne of being constantly thwarted is suggested by a certain intentional blurring of the formal outlines whose clarity you otherwise come to rightfully rely upon. Note how the opening (title) phrase of the song reappers in contexts that make its formal purpose ambiguous. Is it an Intro, or the start of the Verse, or maybe even the end of the Bridge section? I'm going to 'analyze' it below as the start of the Verse section, but its overriding formal ambiguity, per se, that is germane."

      "'Come Together' opens the 'Abbey Road' album with a stylistic gesture that remains, over the long run of their career as well as from our historical view of it 30 years later, one of the Beatles key strengths and accomplishments. Call it what you will: 'stylized', 'neo-classical'; maybe even 'rubber soul' (read: music style, not album title). In essence it's a matter of ironically updating an old style such that even when the antecedent musical elements stand out as painfully obvious, the effect of the stylized writing and production values transcend the model. Think 'evocation' as opposed to 'imitation'; compare this song with the group's covers of songs by Mr. Chuck Berry.",
      "The song weighs in at a lengthy 4:20. Both the form and proportional assignments of time are quite expansive. The first refrain doesn't appear until 1:10, and the extended and harmonically static outro occupies a virtually equivalent amount of time at the end. In the meanwhile that intro recurs over and over. As a result, the mood is one of having all the time in the world, in spite of the fact that both tempo and backbeat are moderately driving. (By the same token, you'll note the detail-sweating wisdom exercised by shortening some of those intro reprises in the second half of the song.)"

It's an exquisitely bittersweet state of heart effectively evoked in the music as much as it is specified by the words. The affirmative and optimistic rising hook phrase that opens and closes the song (as well as each of the verses) is more than amply balanced out by a constant, nagging undertow of literally 'falling' motion in the bassline and tune. The decision to not set that rising hook to vocalized lyrics tells us the score with eloquent reticence."

      "The thrice overdubbed three-part vocal arrangement creates a mood of wide-eyed and unblinkingly rapt contemplation that is sustained wall to wall with almost unaturally calm intensity. Technique-wise it may pay hommage to the earlier Beatles efforts of 'This Boy' and 'Yes It Is', but there is a transcendent element here that reminds me more so of a piece such as Bach's 'Air' from the Third Orchestral Suite; the movement well known as the one for the (you should pardon the expression) 'G string'."

      "Taking a cue from the emphasis in my last note (re: 'She Said She Said') on the undeniable primacy of classic song forms within the Beatles songbook, let's look this time at 'You Never Give Me Your Money' at the other end of the formal spectrum; along with '... Warm Gun', being one of the extremely rare examples in the canon where the Beatles opt for '<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology' target='_blank'>teleological</a> medley' in place of any more traditional periodic / cyclical form.",
      "'You Never Give Me Your Money' is built from three different sections that are nominally compatible, but virtually unrelated to each other. As with all but the final section of '... Warm Gun', you find that while each of the sections here suggests the potential for complete development into a song that can stand on its own, each is presented for now in a fragmentary manner where they rely heavily on the immediate repetition of a single idea to establish any sense of formal autonomy.",
      "On the one hand that makes it easy for the listener to grasp the articulation of the larger form, but it begs the question of how any feeling of unity is brought to bear on such independent diversity. We'll examine each section in turn and come back later to this question.",
      "Each of the three parts has its own rhyme scheme, though none of them is quite large enough, formally, to get into literal repeats of whole sections of words. By the same token, the latter halves of parts Y and Z both feature immediate, multiple repetition of the same line.",
      "All three parts lyrically start off after the downbeat, providing a foil for the children's counting rhyme of the song's outro which very much starts right on it."

      "'Sun King' also amply demonstrates John's often ingenious approach to form. The track is built up from a small number of short phrases or sections that are flexibly repeated and sequenced in the manner mosaic tiles. The larger form of the track is a kind of miniaturized 'bonsai medley,' with a discrete minature song in the middle section that is surrounded on both sides by unusually heavy wrapping of the verse-like outer sections, which by themselves don't quite make up a whole song, minature or otherwise. The mental picture is one of the small hamburger with a very large roll; sort of the opposite of a recent TIME magazine cover photo for an article about the current fad over high protein/fat, low carbo diets."

       "'Mean Mr Mustard' is more a 'discontinued fragment,' than a 'bonsai miniature,' and I say that without intending any pejorative connotations. In context the song makes an excellent fit of form-to-function. Following on the heels of the more substantial and self-contained previous two songs this one critically needs to pick up the pace and get the show on the road, medley-wise. In this case, the short track length, incomplete form, and the tighter, smoother coupling of the track at both ends to the songs that surround it seem as a group of factors to work out just right.",
  "Next note The tempo of 'Mean Mr Mustard' is essentially identical to that of 'Sun King', at least up until the final phrases, but the switch of backbeat from something that lazily flows to a painfully lumbering march that alternates with more syncopated material disguises that fact.",
  "Next note Amazingly, no matter how awkwardly John is caught up with here, compositionally on the run, so to speak, we find him making the effort, expending the bandwidth to work in odd phrase lengths, more mosaic tiling, and a metric modulation. It's not fair to call this just a throwaway."

I believe this musical illusion is created by the extent to which the two preceding fragmentary tracks provide a foil for this one's being relatively full grown in the form department.",
      "This song also turns out to be pretty much the only song in the medley that comes close to approaching one of the traditional forms. And even so, it has the peculiar trait of putting a single verse up front, with two verses between the bridges. Darn clever, those Beatles, hmm?",

Both 'Golden Slumbers' and 'Carry That Weight' are built out of a relatively conventional A-B-A arch form which gives each track the impression of being more-complete/ less-fragementary than either 'Mean Mr Mustard' or 'Polythene Pam'. But that sense of individual completeness is strongly undermined in the final result by their degree of musical inter-relation.",

Its ending is as abrupt as its start is sudden. Before you've quite had a chance to react to it, it's already altogether come and gone.",
